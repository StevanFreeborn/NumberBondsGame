                    Number Bonds is a game that randomly generates number bond problems that you can attempt to solve. You can choose between two different modes: addition and subtraction. You can also choose from a few different difficulty levels. You can thank my son Kal for the Impossible level. He thought the size of the numbers was pretty hilarious.

                    I've been learning to code and as a way of practicing what I've learned I thought it might be fun to try to build a game for my kids that we can use to practice number bond problems using only CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
