                    Number Bonds is a game that randomly generates number bond problems that you can attempt to solve. You can choose between two different modes: addition and subtraction. You can also choose from a few different difficulty levels. You can thank my son Kal for the Impossible level. He thought the size of the numbers was pretty hilarious.

                <p class="my-1">
                    I've been learning to code and as a way of practicing what I've learned I thought it might be fun to try to build a game for my kids that we can use to practice number bond problems using only CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
